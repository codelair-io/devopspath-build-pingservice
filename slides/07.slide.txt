% CI / CD
~Continuous Integration:~
"Practice where developers regularly merge their code changes to a central
repository, after which automated tests are run. CI often refers to the 
build or integration stage of the software release and requires an 
automation component (e.g., a CI or build service)."

~Continuous Delivery:~
"Practice where code changes are automatically build, tested, and 
prepared for production release. It ~expands on CI by deploying code 
~changes to a testing environment, a production environment, or both~ after
the build stage has been completed."

- Can be fully automated, or partially with manual steps at critical points.

~Continuous Deployment:~
"Revisions are deployed to a production environment automatically without
explicit approval from a developer, ~making the entire process automated~"
